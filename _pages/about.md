# ðŸŽ“ Towards Language models that know what they know

My thesis is entitled _Domain adaptation in Pretrained Language Models, Applications to information retrieval and Conversational search_.

Put more simply, we aim at improving information acess using the amazing ability of Pretrained Language Models to _understand_ text, while they're not that amazing at manipulating factual information yet...
