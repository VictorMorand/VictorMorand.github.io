Hi ! I'm Victor, currently PhD Student working in the [MLIA](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/equipes/mlia/) team of the [Institute of Intelligent Systems and Robotics (ISIR)](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/) located in Sorbonne UniversitÃ©, under the supervision of [Benjamin Piwowarski](https://www.piwowarski.fr) and [Josiane Mothe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mothe-josiane-0a29186).


ðŸŽ“ Towards Language models that know what they know
======

The complete title of my Thesis is _Domain adaptation in Pretrained Language Models, Applications to information retrieval and Conversational search_.

But put more simply, our goal is to improve the access to information using the amazing ability of Pretrained Language models to _understand_ text, while they are not that amazing at manipulating factual information ðŸ˜¬.
